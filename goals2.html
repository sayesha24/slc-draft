        <p>During the previous semester, I gained a lot of knowledge through understanding new topics and concepts. I also got a better understanding of the criterias and their expectations for all the subjects. 
            But, in order to continue to improve, I have set some subject specific goals for myself to achieve and show progress in the academics.
